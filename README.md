Okay, the clockmodal is working now.

Question:
How can I implement a debouncer for onChange for notes?? When I see the console, it repeatedly prints whatever is typed. I want to delay it by 2000ms.

Note:
I have implemented a debouncer and a optimized function for handleNotes but it breaks the website.
